### What I Did：
I've created the basic framework for my ToDoList application, just a simple outline with several hardcoded components so far. I've spent most of the time trying to fight with Google Play Store, but up to now, I haven't deployed it with Google yet. So I'll include an APK of my todo app in my GitHub right now.

### What I Learned：
It seems like the Google Play Store only accepts the U.S. driver's license to verify id, which is annoying for new international students who have not yet get the U.S. driver's license, especially noticed that after paying for the $25 fee.

(**New update: ** Although I still can't be verified to publish my app on Google Play Store, I was able to dispute the charge with my credit card bank, and it works! I've got my $25 back :) 

Although the whole process of dealing with the Google Play Store was somehow painful, and so far I haven't reached there yet, but I've learned a lot of policies and precautions regarding publishing an application to Google Play Store. 

I'll definitely pay more attention to the detailed design part and avoid violation of the publishing requirements. Hopefully, I can get my U.S. driver's license in the near future so that I could play with Google Play Store a bit more.
