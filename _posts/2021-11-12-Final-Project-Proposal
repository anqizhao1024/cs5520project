### EXTEND MY TODO APP

I would like to adding following 3 new features to my ToDo app:

(MED) Implement Sorting and Filtering of the To-Do Items on the main page of your app 
(MED) Implement Searching for To-Dos
(HARD) Incorporate a Third-Party API, such as Spotify (?)-- BUT: make sure that it makes sense 

I've chosen these features to add to my ToDo app because I can no longer stand the notepad app I am using currently.
