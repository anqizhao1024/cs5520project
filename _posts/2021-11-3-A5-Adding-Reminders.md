### What I Did：
I've added a time picker, along with a notification feature to display an alert at the picked time.

### What I Learned：
There are lots of different formats of having a time picker, and the roller I've tried to play with right now is easy when deployed but could be annoying to the user. 

I realized after playing with it on my physical phone, that the roller format is easy to make mistakes but hard to realize the mistake. Because the roller might run when scrolling the screen, I'll try to change it in my final project.

Additionally, I've learned the use of BroadcastReceiver for Android broadcasting, the use of time and date controls,how to trigger the use of AlarmManager.

Lastly, the mutual conversion between date and strings are important, and pay attention to the accuracy of time.
