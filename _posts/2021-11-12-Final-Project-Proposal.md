### EXTEND MY TODO APP

I would add the following three new features to my ToDo app:

(MED) Implement Sorting and Filtering of the To-Do Items on the main page of your app 

(MED) Implement Searching for To-Dos

(HARD) Incorporate a Third-Party API, such as Spotify (?)-- BUT: make sure that it makes sense 

I have chosen these features to add to my ToDo app because I can no longer stand the Notes app that I am using currently. 

I am using a Xiaomi Android phone, and the system carries a default Notes app, whereas I use it as a to-do list in my daily life. It technically works as its name, where the user can use it to take notes to remind or plan themselves. But probably because it's just a default basic notes app, it lacks many features to make the using process a better experience. 

For example, it will sort by either the creation date from old to new or the last edit date from new to old, which is annoying when I try to find something I know will happen shortly but have created it a long time ago and never edit it again. 

So I think it will be a great idea to implement sorting and filtering of the to-do items on the main page of my app. Allowing users to sort and filter things in a more flexible way based on their needs will absolutely be a lifesaver when there's a giant list of things to do.

Implementing searching for to-dos is definitely another great idea, but I'll take a little bit more time on thinking about what I would do in this feature. 

Sometimes, I use my notes app in a really casual way, and I'll mistype or misspell some words. But my notes app searching features will only get the result that 100% matches the content. So that it happens when I can't remember how did I spell the word or if I used another synonym word instead, I can hardly find the note that I needed. 

But I'm not sure how will I implement this feature yet, especially for the synonym search and how should I define misspell. In my mother tongue Mandarin, it could be done by searching similar pronunciations or shapes of that word because of the input method, but in English, the length of each word is different and the synonym words are also not my area of expertise. Anyways, I'll give this feature a try and see where I could get in a limited time.

Lastly, I chose to incorporate a third-party API, such as Spotify because I've never tried that before and would like to give myself some challenge. Although the HARD tag freaks me out a little bit, I'll spend more time researching it, and hopefully, I won't give up on this one.
